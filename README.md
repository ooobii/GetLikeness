## What is 'GetLikeness'?
This project is a Visual Basic script for Excel that adds 2 functions for processing precise levels of equality between two strings.


In Excel, sometimes you need to determine exact equality between two strings. This can easily be done by using the '=' operator within an Excel function or VBA statement. But what if the strings are not in the same case? What if one contains a period, one doesnt, but other than that the strings are equal?

Excel only supports direct equality tests, resulting in TRUE or FALSE values. These 2 functions will instead return a percentage value based on similar characters and concurant character patterns seen within the test subjects.
